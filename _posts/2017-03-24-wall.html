      I wrote the following two days before I found out I had a major UTI (apparently kidney pain feels like cramps), before I booked the next leg of my trip, at a real low point. And while I no longer feel this way, I think it’s important to show a negative side of traveling not often publicized.

    <p>I’ve hit a wall. </p>

<p>I got food poisoning my first week in Thailand, either from a vegetable or a mojito, and my body’s been off ever since. A week later I had to say goodbye to someone I fell in love with, and I have not been handling it well. Add to this the fact that I am not nearly as into Thailand as expected, and I’ve been struggling.</p>

<p>The past week has been rough. And it’s making me homesick.  And guilty for being homesick.</p>

<p>I don’t feel useful, and I don’t feel like I’m having fun either. I wrote in my first post about my desire to do my part overseas. but I don’t think that’s actually happening. I don’t think I’d necessarily be doing more were I at home, and I can spin my travel experiences and web development projects as worthy causes (if I actually focus and work more), but if my stress dreams are any indication my own brain ain’t buyin' it. And if I’m not doing anything worthwhile, I should at least be having a blast, right? What's wrong with me?</p>

<p>Saying all this seems whiny and selfish. It’s pretty ridiculous to complain to friends back home that I feel guilty for traveling yet continuing to travel. It’s the ultimate dick move: I make them listen to me complain about doing something they’d love to be doing, yet refuse to stop doing it.</p>

<p>I’ve met people before who were burnt out on traveling. I promised myself that wouldn’t happen to me, and i never expected it to happen two months in. Maybe because my trip isn’t open-ended it’s making it harder to avoid the “what if” game I play where maybe I should have optimized my trip better and gone to different places. Or moved faster.</p>

<p>I miss my cat. I miss my friends, wifey, my family, J. I miss my apartment. I miss New York, even in the winter. I’m at the point where actually I miss being cold. I miss my shoes and clothes that aren’t wrinkled. I really really miss the gym, to an embarrassing degree.</p>

<p>I’m tired. I’m tired of how much my body hurts. I’m tired of heat and mosquitoes. I’m tired of how long it takes to get anywhere and shitty wifi. I’m tired of people judging the way that I travel or where I travel. I’m tired of feeling like I’m missing out on things at home but also not seeing everything I wanted to see here. I’m tired of thinking I went to the wrong island or skipped the wrong beach or stayed at the wrong hostel and missed out on some great time because of it.<p>

<p>And I’m scared, too. I’m scared that I wont enjoy the rest of my trip. I’m scared I won’t be writing, that I’ll completely forget how to code, that I’ll be so exhausted that I’ll come back to the states with nothing to show for my months away except new sun damage. That I still won’t be out of the rut that I ran away from, that I’ll be unemployable and unlovable, and that I’ll just fall directly back into negative past habits.</p>

<p>But, always the foolish optimist I’m somewhat grateful for this week. Because it's made me snap out of happy travel mode and look at WTF i’m actually doing. Maybe feeling this way will be another opportunity to face the things I was dealing with in the US, instead of assuming that traveling will turn me into some new, better version of myself.</p>
