        <span>Clearly</span> I shouldn't have gotten on the scooter.  I’m not usually trusting of strangers, and I’m especially vigilant when traveling alone as a woman.  Maybe a month of the kindness of Southeast Asian locals had worn me down; maybe it was the earsplitting thunder while standing on top of a giant hill; or maybe it was because I had just met a couple who said they were getting around the area by hitchhiking due to a lack of cabs.  But whatever the reason, the prospect of catching a ride 2 miles uphill rather than climbing and potentially being struck by lightning was too tempting to refuse.

        I jokingly messaged a friend that if she didn’t hear from me in an hour I’d been kidnapped; she laughed and said it was fine, that she got scooter rides from strangers on the reg.  The guy on the bike (I never learned his name) and I briefly discussed where he was going to take me--I said the center of town, not wanting him to know exactly where I was staying.  He said something I couldn’t understand but pointed to the correct area on my phone map, and I hopped on.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then, suddenly, we were barreling the wrong direction down the mountain, away from the center of town, away from where I was staying, as I frantically yelled to him that he was going the wrong way.

      To be fair, I probably agreed to go with him to our as-yet-unknown destination, although he definitely lied about its location.  But I still contest that when your passenger repeatedly yells that you are going the wrong way and need to let her off or take her home, you let her the fuck off of the scooter or go where you promised.  I could maybe have done something to stop him--caused a scene or started screaming, but he had a helmet and I didn’t, I’m terrified of scooters, and we were flying down the road at a startling speed.  I figured abduction was better than dying on the side of a highway in Malaysia.  So I just sat there, held on, and occasionally pleaded with him to stop, only to be rebuffed or ignored over and over.

      <span>A lot</span> went through my mind during the 20 minute ride further and further away from my actual destination.  At first I thought he was just confused and had made a wrong turn.  That quickly proved false, and since his responses to my protests included such phrases as “great place to take pictures” and “sell souvenirs,” I started to believe he worked for a hotel or tourist attraction and was taking me there to make me buy some random shit before he’d drive me home.  As we turned off the highway onto a back road, I began to wonder if we were headed to friends of his who would extort money.  I wasn't exactly scared for my life, but I could not figure out what he wanted, and he wasn't exactly forthcoming with information.

      I was still guessing while being forced (or maybe not forced; he never actually showed me a weapon) to walk in front of him, uphill, through a closed tea plantation.  It wasn’t until we stopped at the peak and, while picking burrs off of my thigh, he looked up and asked if I was married that I finally realized his true intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t try to force me to do anything other than sit on the ground next to him; I refused and tried to stay as far away as possible.  I upgraded the two guys I had met at the guesthouse the night before from “fellow travelers” to "live-in boyfriend and close friend" in the hopes that this would deter him.  He still kept trying, claiming we’d be spotted by “Indians” who were on the road below if I didn't get down by him in the bushes.  After a period of disagreement I finally snapped, saying that worst case they’d kick us out, and I wanted to go so that was fine by me.

      He didn’t drive me home that time either.  He drove me past some beautiful scenery, to an old dam that was closed off, then turned around and took me back to the same fucking plantation, but a spot slightly closer to a village we’d passed.  So when he started walking uphill into the bushes without forcing me to go first, I spun around and headed down the road on foot.  He came up on his scooter and I gave him my best fed-up-with-this-shit face.

      He nodded, unhappily, and I got back on the scooter.  What was my other option?  I was in the middle of nowhere with no cell reception about 12 miles from where I was staying.  I’d have to hitchhike to get home for certain now.  Better the kidnapper you know than the murderer you don’t, as the saying goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I finally got off the bike at the edge of town two hours after the ordeal started, covered in dirt, scratched and bruised, I inexplicably gave the guy 10 Rupiah and said “thanks for the ride.”  It was incredibly awkward.  He felt that I had misled him and was annoyed that there had been no romantic aspect to our time together, and I felt that I had just paid a kidnapper out of some weird guilt for whatever misunderstanding had just taken place.

      <span>I've had</span> mixed feelings about this experience since.  Immediately after, I jumped whenever I heard an engine behind me.  The night of, I felt for the guy, who I believe viewed the situation as “I’m just showing my new friend and potential GF this amazing place I call home.”  I was also weirdly grateful I had gotten to see some beautiful areas I wouldn’t have explored on my own, and to have such an odd story to tell.  But the next day, on the bus to Penang, I started to feel scared, disgusted, and like this was just par for the female course.

      Because while this was my first kidnapping, it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with men ignoring my protests and desires.  I’ve been followed around and grabbed by men I’ve said no to.  I’ve had someone remove my clothes while I kicked at him.  I’ve had a guy I casually dated for a month harass me for nearly three years after I broke it off.  Part of what I’ve loved about traveling is a version of myself who is more open to new people, one who doesn't walk around on the defensive or let past bad experiences limit her.  And I am so angry at this person for potentially taking that from me.

      But he didn’t succeed.  As I walked back to my guesthouse, vaguely in shock, an older Malay man warmly said "hi" to me, and I genuinely smiled as I greeted him in return.  Because one misguided young man isn’t going to ruin the faith I’m working hard to build in others, and one idiot kid doesn’t represent a whole society or gender.

       I 100% believe this person’s intentions were not malicious and that he meant me no harm, but it was still a horrible thing to do.  You cannot force someone to go to a “romantic” location with you.  You cannot ignore someone’s protests with the idea that they’ll come around and end up enjoying it.  Situations like this are why women all over the world continue to claim that, however it may seem, we do not have true equality, where the term "rape culture" originates.  In a rare turn of events, I was likely physically stronger than my would-be captor (I had a couple inches and maybe 10lbs on him), but he still felt that he had the right to take me somewhere against my will, and I still felt I had no power to stop him.

      <span>I just</span> spent a month with one of the most wonderful men I’ve ever met, someone who has had a lasting, positive impact on how I see myself and what I can expect from love and relationships.  But I also had this experience.  And a major difference between the two is that from the very beginning with J, although he was much bigger than me, I felt completely safe, even on the back of his death-trap scooter.  Because he respected me, I knew he would never do anything to hurt me.  And with this stranger, although I had the size advantage, I felt extremely unsafe because from the get-go he couldn’t care less about what I wanted, only what he wanted from me.

      The takeaway here isn't that traveling while female is unsafe because it will lead to crazy situations #dangerzone.  I think it's the opposite--that actually this shit happens every day, all over the world, in different forms.  My story is weird, but it's not unique.  I can guarantee that at least one woman you know has had a similar experience--an experience where what she wanted or needed was ignored by a stranger, partner, or acquaintance.  Maybe it's more interesting to write about the absurd example, but the situation is commonplace.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that's the way I want to end this story, to move past it, to get it out of my head.  It's not unusual.  It's not crazy.  It's just another example of what women have to deal with and what I hope to help change.  So to that guy, whose name I never learned, you aren't special.  You didn't do anything out of the ordinary.  You tried to pick up a chick and failed miserably.  But maybe next time don't waste two hours of someone's life and terrify them half to death.  And definitely, definitely, don't make them break into a fucking tea plantation; the cuts on my legs are still healing.
