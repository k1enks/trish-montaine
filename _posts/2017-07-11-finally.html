      It’s now been FOUR months since I posted anything, leaving this site, for all intents and purposes, defunct. Dead.

      Three months ago I had a post all ready to go about the “inevitable truths of traveling,” including far too many items related to how terrible I smelled. But then my laptop was stolen and I spent three weeks sans-computer, unable to post any of the many travel meta-posts I was working on at the end of my trip.

      Then I came home, and updating my blog fell pretty far down the totem pole, after “stop crying," “get it together” and “stop crying, seriously.” While some of my to-do's have been completed (I'm no longer crying), I’m still very much figuring out my life and what I want going forward.

      But I have figured out at least one thing, making me glad that I didn't post my inevitable truths on here, because I want to announce a split between this site and a more travel-oriented one.

      Trish Montaine was never meant to be a travel blog; I talked about backpacking because that’s what I was doing at the site’s inception. And even these posts are more about my own feelings and interactions than anywhere I actually went. Now that I’m no longer on the road (at least for the moment), I want to write different content. But I'm also working on what I’ve dubbed “the world’s worst travel blog,” where I include no helpful lists or tips, and instead write about feelings and experiences. Undoubtedly some of this information will be helpful to other women traveling alone, but it’s purely by accident.

      I was going to announcing the launch of my other unnecessary blog I will forget to update: SoloFemale.com, but at the moment I have too much else on my plate (including applying for writing fellowships) to give it the attention it deserves.  I have lofty goals for the future of this brand, when I'm ready to dive back into it, so get hyped.

      And, I promise you, there is a real, actual post about Charlottesville and being an American Southerner and family and history and etc coming TOMORROW to TM, because this does not count.
