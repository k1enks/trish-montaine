        <span>I awoke</span> the day after the election reluctantly, passing back out every time the image of “president Trump” at a podium appeared and caused my brain to short-circuit. Finally I dragged myself out of bed, cried while making coffee, and flopped apathetically on my parents' couch to watch MSNBC struggle with what had happened the night before.

                No one could really believe it—least of all Mr. Trump—and my friends in New York were especially floored.  I had always viewed this as a possibility;

my parents' house is about 10 miles from West Virginia, a state that was clearly going Team T.  But by the time I voted, I truly believed we would have our first female president.
        And I handled the results as poorly as one might expect.  I felt unwanted by the “silent majority” (that was NOT actually a majority, and don’t you forget it!) that had voted for a disgusting, racist, sexist d-bag.  I had already planned a several month trip out of the US, and I seriously considered the possibility of just staying abroad for a year or two, as selfish as that move may have been.  My reaction was basically fuck this, fuck you, and fuck everyone else.  You hate me, so TRISH OUT.

      Experiencing my election hangover in Appalachia saved me. I bumped into Trump supporters I knew who didn't mention it. I went to West Virginia and nobody gloated or yelled at me. While it felt uncomfortable to ignore something SOOO YUUUGE, it stopped me from falling into the same divisive thinking that facilitated this hateful nationalism in the first place. Because I was able to relate to those around me, and I didn’t feel actively unwanted the way I had when I woke up*, it kept me connected to my country in spite of what I viewed as impossibly bad choices.  I spent the next few weeks refusing to succumb to my misery, instead being obnoxiously optimistic, hoping this result might bring to light some shit that was more subtle before Cheeto Mussolini.

        I was not the only one with that idea; nationwide there were calls to avoid becoming hateful or bailing to Canada but to instead work on supporting one another and standing together in opposition. There was actual, visceral fear, and there were racist attacks, but in response there was also a massive outpouring of solidarity and protection (<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/01/31/texas-capitol-rally-muslim-advocacy-day-draws-1000/">

    <span>This Is</span> important, because kum-bay-ya-ing isn’t enough. Love your neighbor or whatever, but FUCK just letting terrible things happen for the sake of staying on pleasant terms. One of the biggest questions after the election was whether people would stay vigilant, stay angry, and continue to exercise their right to protest and question their government. Or if they would just say “fuck it” and roll with the status quo. I am so glad that people still aggressively give a shit, and that you see it all over the country, not just in specific liberal cities.  There were women’s marches and rallies in conservative towns, in rural areas that might only have a handful of protestors.  Small and large scale activism alike exploded, shocking people with sheer protestor numbers and straight up crashing the ACLU’s site with donations.

    In this environment of actually getting up and doing, I found myself on the side of excuses rather than action.  I have talked about writing on “women’s issues” and current events for a long time, but as much as I harassed people at parties or sent angry emails, I never really put myself out there.  I was afraid and, honestly, I was lazy.  It’s always easier to do nothing.  And when I thought about what I wanted to write, it wasn’t the snarky bullshit that comes naturally to me.  I could easily write 500 words on “why everything is horrible in Wisconsin” or “I want to give Scott Walker a vaginal ultrasound,” but that isn’t helpful, and that isn’t furthering dialogue.

    My grandfather, who died almost exactly a year ago and has played a huge part in my life, ended up being my inspiration.  He saw the best and worst in society, and he was painfully conscious of America’s repeated moves away from what he considered just.  But he was never, ever cynical or lost faith that people are innately good.  He was an activist, whereas until now I’ve basically been whiny.  So, before I started my trip, I promised that I would stay open, STAY WOKE, and actually write shit down.

In that spirit, the last thing I did before leaving the US was take part in the women’s march in Seattle, and I could not imagine a better or more inspiring send-off. More than 100,000 people (over twice the expected attendance) marched with signs and pussy hats, chanting, banging drums, and occasionally singing. I cried about 7 times; I made friends with amazing women; I began to question my creative abilities because the signs were so great.  And it helped me remember that while I’m just one voice in a sea of people who want to talk about this stuff, I still have to show up and be counted.

  <span>I Fucking love</span> America. She’s far from perfect, and especially now she’s in a really messed up place. She needs to sit the fuck down and think about what she’s doing. I feel guilty that I’m not there to help put her in time out; sometimes I worry I should have canceled my trip and spent this time instead volunteering and protesting at home.  And while I didn’t do that for a multitude of reasons I may someday discuss here, I am so fucking proud of and impressed with the activists at home.  Maybe Trump did in some form M.A.G.A. by spurring an amount of activity that I don’t remember seeing in my lifetime, and a lasting vigilance that is extremely impressive considering New Years resolutions are generally abandoned about a week in.  This site is an attempt to keep up my end, to do my part from overseas.
</p>
<p>
  So I may not be there now, but I will be back in June with a vengeance, ready to help bring out America’s best self.  I can't call my congressmen, but Scott Walker is getting some angry postcards from Bali, and I’ll be continuing my streak of drunk Yelp reviews with some Trump brand products.  I will continue to discuss America abroad with anyone who brings it up, because I understand how terrifying it is globally that a major superpower (for now, at least) just elected an unhinged reality tv star with a giant chip on his shoulder.  And I will continue to write here, as Trish, not exclusively about travel or American politics, or international relations, or reproductive rights, but on some combination, since no man is an island and we’re all in this shit together.  HOPE YOU DON’T HATE IT!
