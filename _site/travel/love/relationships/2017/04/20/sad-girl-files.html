      Last week I had to make the call to put my cat, Snuggles “Baby” Montaine*, who had lived with me for nearly 21 years and was the closest thing I have to a child, to sleep. Sobbing on the phone with Sam*, he talked me through a decision I didn’t want to make, something I hoped would wait until I was home. And exactly 7 days later I was on the phone with him again, talking through another painful decision I’d been trying to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met Sam about two weeks into my trip, the night I got a free tattoo at Deus. We were introduced by a guy I had become friends with in Uluwatu, and between my drunken sprints around the bar we talked a lot and eventually kissed goodnight when I headed home. Under normal circumstances, it probably would never have become more than that. Or we would have hooked up immediately and then I would have been over it or gotten weird or clingy. But because I was staying at ladies’ coding camp and he was staying with people I knew, we ended up getting to know each other over the course of a week without anything more happening.
    </p>
  </div>

    <p>
      Once the class was over I stayed with him and his friends for a couple nights before saying goodbye and heading off to Malaysia. But things had already gotten uncharacteristically intense for me, and I missed him. Apparently he felt the same because he ended up meeting me in Penang and we spent two more weeks traveling up into Thailand together. Again uncharacteristically and as improbable as it may sound, we really fell in love in that time. When you spend 24 hours a day with someone and deal with all the stress of traveling and the intensity of experiencing amazing new places together, things happen really quickly. He even took care of me when I got food poisoning, a level of intimacy I NEVER imagined I could handle. Then he left and I promised to visit in the fall, but we didn’t discuss anything more about the future. From the beginning we had said it would be impossible to actually be a couple and that we never wanted to miss out on our own lives due to being attached to someone far away, so when we said goodbye that would be it except we would stay friends.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-right col-6_sm-12">
    <p>
      Again, I missed him. I was still in Thailand, staying with friends who also knew him, and it all felt too familiar. Coconuts reminded me of him, because I hated them but I’d drink them because they were “good for me.” Massages reminded me of him, because again, I normally hated them but he was able to talk me into it. Thai cover bands, street food, bamboo tattoos, everything around me was too connected to him. And he was not very communicative his first week or so home. I was fielding questions about our convos and would have to say that I hadn’t heard from him. It hurt; I felt like shit; I was convinced he’d gone back to real life and forgotten about me and I didn’t understand why I was having so much trouble bouncing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because this was all completely new for me—I’ve never let anyone get that close. He broke down all my defenses and was patient as I tried to get over the self sabatoging tendencies that kick in whenever I start to care too much. He is the first person I can say I’ve really, truly been in love with in any functional and reciprocated way. And then he was gone and I didn’t know what to do. I had no expectations; I just knew that it hurt that he wasn’t with me.

      But then we started talking more, and somehow I was able to convince him to come meet me again. He had another 10 days he could take before work really started, but it had to be certain dates, so he ended up coming to Egypt. It was another intense week for us. He saw me cry, more than once. Things were often harder than they had been in Southeast Asia, and we were doing more organized activities while he dealt with jet lag, so there were brief tense moments but, amazingly, we never actually got mad at each other. By the end we finally talked about “the future,” but it didn’t really get anywhere. It was a lot of expression of feelings with the only actual agreement being that we would aim to talk on the phone every week.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-right col-6_sm-12">
    <p>
      And then he left again. And I was really sad. But this time at least I left the country and went to Lebanon, where I stayed with family friends in Beirut and had people to distract me. I ate lots of food and had a cold. I met fancy old people. And every night I talked to Sam. I wasn’t attracted to anyone else and, although I enjoyed people I met, no one else drew me in. I hated that I felt this constant pull to someone that wasn’t there, but it was happening, and our conversations became more frequent and more intense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I went to Istanbul. We talked a lot while I was here, but I was also traveling solo again and meeting people at the hostel I really liked. One person in particular I became very close to and had really intense conversations with, first about politics (duh), and then, facilitated by a gay Canadian (the best kind), about love and sex and relationships. Nothing happened between us, but it made me question for the first time whether I could potentially see myself with someone else. Not because I loved Sam any less or because of a specific attraction, but because of the possibility that I could enjoy something (or someone) completely different. This carried on into Israel, where, while dealing with this question I also saw an increasing disconnect between the original agreement of no expectations and the conversations we were having that bordered on plans for an official relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything came to a head one night when I was forced to yet again explain to people who Sam was, and a barrage of questions followed. I had started saying “it’s complicated” when people asked me if I had a boyfriend, and that was the honest truth. But repeatedly answering what we were, what I expected from the future, how long we’d been together, etc, kept reintroducing the doubt that first arose in Istanbul. It had always been a given that this was temporary and that I’d have to move on. But I had been reluctant to do so and now found myself torn between two possibilities, unsure of which I actually wanted.

      I’ve always been bad at knowing what I want and sticking with it, which is another reason why I’ve always been single. New York is known for being a terrible place to date because everyone has relationship FOMO ("fear of missing out" for the adults here) and won’t commit based on the idea a better match could still be out there. I definitely fit that stereotype. For the first time I was able to get over my hangups and completely be with someone, but now I’d started to worry that it was only temporary, that if I committed long-term that I’d feel limited. Maybe I hadn’t changed after all, it was just a product of my environment.

      So what’s the right answer in this situation?  In a travel/hostel context, where casual romances are the norm and attachment is frowned upon, what happens when you actually fall for someone? And then, after that, when you're apart but very much still together? And then when you start to connect with other people and consider the possibility of moving on, but you don't know whether that's what you want? You don’t feel ready, but maybe eventually? And is it possible to maintain that same closeness with someone but also try to be present and not give yourself limits? Isn't that unfair to the voice on the other end of the phone who isn’t traveling and is telling you how much they love you? If you love them too but you don’t know that it is going to work out long term and you feel like you’re just getting deeper into something that might not last? What will you want when you return to “real life;” will you regret letting them go or will you regret the opposite, not being fully open because you were hung up on someone far away?

      I still don’t know because traveling long(ish) term destroys your sense of grounding and context. You can’t necessarily gauge how you would feel about something at home or in the future. You have to exist moment to moment. It can be very freeing—I think this is what allowed me to open up so much in the first place—but it’s also why I have no way of truly committing. It’s not about giving myself the freedom to do anything with anyone else; it’s that I would hate to spend the next month and a half stringing him along with promises of what it will be like when we are on the same continent and then realizing it isn’t something I can do. In some ways we know each other so, so well, but on the other hand we actually don’t know each other at all. We've never even met in a non-travel context.
    </p>

      Because everyone has different expectations and every relationship is different, I secretly hoped that we could find a middle ground where I could still talk to him every day and he’d be okay with no commitment. But as hard as it is, it’s good that he basically gave me an ultimatum. Having someone on this trip means that I’ve never really had to be alone. If we continued in this form of limbo, I think it would have been too much of a “have your cake and eat it too” situation, wherein I would have this comfort and certainty but zero commitment. Which would be the emotional equivalent of trying to keep my cat alive rather than making the call. And this trip is about growing as a person, which I have so much through him, but now I need to stop using it as a safety net and take the next emotional step.
    </p>

    <p>
      It feels selfish ending it rather than going all in, but it would be way more selfish not to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because I know that everything I’ve said to him I’ve meant, but I right now I can’t separate “travel love” from “real love,” and I don’t know how much he has come to represent everything that I miss about home wrapped up in one person, and it’s become clear that if I can’t answer all my questions then I don’t deserve the comfort that comes along with having someone love you so much. I owe it to him to give him space and not reach out whenever something funny or difficult happens, even though it’s my first instinct. And even though it kills me to remember his voice on the phone, a sudden coldness that made me want to say “nevermind, let’s just be together,” because I do absolutely love him and miss him and want to see him again as soon as possible, I still believe we made the right decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      That just doesn’t make it any easier.
