        I don’t personally know Harvey Weinstein; we were never officially introduced. I did, however, work two floors above him for several years in the Tribeca Film Center, so we’ve interacted. He was notorious in ‘the biz’ for being a not-quite-Scott-Rudin-level asshole (of Hollywood Reporter comparison spread fame), whose aggressive tactics were often excused by the fact that he did really seem to care passionately about his work, staying in the editing room as late as necessary for him to walk away happy. He was also infamous on floor 5 for once eating a colleague’s dinner when it was mis-delivered to him by his assistant. And he was obviously gross towards women, to the point where when the allegations against him recently exploded my exact words were “yeah, duh.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t have new information about him that makes it necessary to throw my hat into the ring, other than to express how apparent it should have been to those around him. I’m not saying that anyone is lying about not being aware, just that it shows both how clueless people can be and a culture where this behavior didn’t stand out. All Weinstein ever did to me was turn around in an elevator to slowly and obviously look me up and down, as though wondering what value I might have as a person sharing his air. Usually I just saw him yelling at various underlings, as was his wont. But this one time, when walking down the block away from TFC, I saw him run into a former employee and give her the same up and down he’d given me, leering and saying “You look great, call me” or something to that effect (he may have said “you look hot, let’s do lunch,” which is clearly just as bad). I was so disgusted by his actions towards a girl who could not have been more that 25 that I inadvertently said “EWW!” loudly (he didn't hear). But had I been in her shoes I think I would have done exactly what she did, which was to nervously laugh and carry on with her day as though a married old man she once worked for hadn’t just cat-called her.

    So now we get to the crux of what this whole drama has led me to consider: my own failure to ever stand up against this when it happened to me. I’m outspoken, feminist, and yet I completely defer to authoritative men in the moment, even if I lash out after the fact. We hold the women to whom this happens to such absurd standards, and it’s easy to look back and excuse silence in “a different era” like the 80s when Cosby was (allegedly) raping his way through Hollywood because the police were especially dismissive back then. People seem to have a harder time empathizing with women who don’t report their attackers now. They don’t understand that it’s still incredibly scary and difficult to come forward, especially if you’re up against someone with a reputation and power. Additionally, it isn’t usually straight up rape by a stranger, although even when it is the rapist isn’t always punished appropriately (NEVER FORGET BROCK TURNER). If Harvey Weinstein had cornered me in a dark alley and raped me in 2014 I probably would have reported it, but if he had coerced me on TFC property, if I’d been drinking, or if I felt I had led him on in any way by showing him attention, I probably wouldn’t have. Admitting this feels wrong and disgusting and like I’m a “bad feminist,” but it’s honest, and based on my reactions to former sexual harassment. So, today, I’m doing what I never did before and calling out publicly three men whose inappropriate actions still upset and weigh on me years later (their full names haven’t been included because I can’t remember them, and I have no interest in looking these men up).

    The summer after my sophomore year at William and Mary I started pre-med, taking General Chemistry and then Organic. We had a different professor for Orgo, but the same lab TA. This particular TA had cornered multiple female students during class and asked them on dates, including Sara, my sometimes lab partner. He never made any advances towards me, either because I wasn’t his type or because I was very obviously sleeping with another student, but Sara told me how uncomfortable she felt when he boxed her in against one of the hoods and asked if she would go out with him. By the time Organic started, he was dating one of the students from that former lab, so it should have been clear to the higher-ups that he was being inappropriate. But, of course, it wasn’t. And no one came forward; we honestly felt kind of bad for him because he was so desperate for female attention and thought he was harmless, pathetic.

    One time on a Gen Chem quiz, I shared a calculator with another student, and someone thought we were cheating. The professor docked us both points even though our papers showed that we had not shared any information (I got 100% and he failed the quiz), and I was cleared by the school. But one morning, about halfway through Orgo, we received an email from this TA claiming that “a student who had been caught cheating was shown to have cheated again,” and threatening that he was taking action.

  When I got to lab he slammed my previous day’s work down on the table and told me that “There is no way that this math can lead to these results.” I calmly did the math, which checked out, and he turned red with anger. He didn’t apologize. In reality, my friend Sara had used my work to check her own during class, and had miscopied a couple numbers. But, naturally, I was the one he accused, because he still had gross, creepy feelings for Sara. How did this end? Sara dropped out of the class because she couldn’t handle seeing this predator face-to-face every day. I stayed in the class after the TA was told not to talk to me anymore and that he wasn’t allowed to grade any more of my work; I gave my labs to the professor instead. He never had to apologize publicly, so most of the class believed I was a cheater, and this reputation followed me into my junior year despite my innocence. The TA was allowed to continue working. Basically, he was the only person not negatively impacted by this scandal. At least I got an A in Organic, so fuck you, you shitty TA whose name I can’t remember, I was a great student.
    (I will also mention that at Andover, William and Mary was known as the “date rape school,” because our speaker about campus rape had been attacked while a student there and the administration had not helped her. Not shocked. #TWAMS (Typical William and Mary Story))

      The following summer, after my junior year, I worked at one of the three Hampton Inns in Williamsburg, VA as a front desk attendant. At first I loved my job; it was easy, paid me, and I liked my coworkers, including our sweet and funny manager. But a few weeks into my tenure he moved away and Josef, a man who had worked alongside me and become somewhat obsessed with me, was put in charge. Josef was not a good manager or a good person. He was controlling and obsessive, insisting we stand for our full 8 hour shifts because he thought stools made the hotel look bad. He was nitpicky about weirdly specific things, like our sock color, even if it had been approved by the owner. But mostly he stared at me, asked me out, and was creepily all over me to the point that other hotel employees asked if I was ok and what the fuck was going on. When classes started in the fall, I told the owner that I could only work 2-3 days a week, which he approved. I gave him and Josef copies of my class schedule that they needed to work around. And every single week Josef would assign me more days than I could handle, including shifts that overlapped with class, so I would have to personally go talk to him, since at this point he knew I was avoiding him. This was such an obvious case of workplace harassment that it seems insane I didn’t come forward, but I tried to. I complained to the owner, a sweet older man who saw himself as almost a father figure to me. But he didn’t believe what I was saying, and I thought going over his head to any authorities would hurt him more than Josef. I didn’t want to do that, and I also didn’t know that I would be believed, as I had engaged in a relationship with someone else who worked at the hotel. I figured this information would be thrown at me to show that I wanted the attention. Between these two factors I ended up just quitting—-at 4am without giving notice because I was so panicked about it and also wanted to hurt Josef just once—-rather than trying to improve the situation.

            And let’s fast forward to last September, in 2016, when I went to housing court for a second time over leaks in my bathroom that my landlord was failing to fix because he owns about 200 buildings and doesn’t care if they are falling down. He has a law firm on retainer, Green and Cohen. The first time I went to court I did it solo, but this time I hired a lawyer because I wanted them to take me seriously and treat me with respect. However, instead of taking me seriously, upon meeting me their representative said to my lawyer,

  <div class="content-right col-6_sm-12">
    <p>
 “Oh yeah, I heard a pretty girl lived there,” and winked at me. And what did I do? I blushed and smiled meekly, totally disarmed and shocked by this behavior and the wedding ring on his finger. My desire to be accommodating took over even when I was actively in court against this person. My lawyer said nothing, meaning this is either par for the course or he didn’t hear, equally possible options. I don’t blame him, but I wish he had said something about that being inappropriate so I didn’t have to.

      There are countless other small examples like this, things that have confused me when it came to understanding my value as a person and a woman. From someone making me sit on his lap to someone telling me I could have discounted services for sexual favors, I haven’t always been able to say no the way I would have hoped. Sometimes the line is clear—-the sexual favors guy was easy to turn down by angrily paying full price—-but sometimes it’s hard to justify causing a scene if you feel like the slight is close to innocuous. I’m a half-Catholic half-WASP from the South; I was not raised to rock the boat. And I am a very flirty person who won’t read well as a victim of unwanted sexual advances. I came of age during the era when tight jeans were literally used to justify rape in a court of law, so how can I be expected to trust myself and come forward if I might have looked sexually appealing to someone at some point? Isn’t that me asking for it? I did put on makeup, right, and maybe someone could see the outline of my boob, so how dare I spurn these advances? How dare I complain unless I was raped by a stranger with a gun, sober, while wearing a modest outfit? And even then, WOW I'm being soooo self absorbed thinking this rapist was interested in someone who looks like me, an ugly dumb bitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope putting this here will help me feel some sense of closure, like I finally shared my story in a way that is permanent and I know will be read by people on multiple continents from multiple backgrounds, not just those I complained to while it was happening. I also think that sharing it is potentially valuable, because a lot of these people will be surprised to hear that I roll over so often instead of doing anything. It seems out of character. So if any of you reading this are surprised, realize how fucking hard it actually is to come forward, to be the first one to say something happened. Don’t look at this like “OMG ALL THESE PEOPLE COMING OUT SO LATE THEY JUST WANT MONEY AND TO ADD TO THE FIRE,” but instead look at it like “OMG LOOK HOW MANY PEOPLE DIDN’T REALIZE QUITE HOW COMMON THEIR STORY WAS AND POTENTIALLY BLAMED THEMSELVES OR FEARED FOR THEIR CAREERS AND PRIVACY IF THEY HAD COME FORWARD.” Because, honestly, I wouldn’t have been strong enough to say anything about Harvey Weinstein to an authority. But I’m hoping that in the future I’ll be able to stand my ground instead of being accommodating. You can do your part by believing me.
