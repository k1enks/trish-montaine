    <p>Let me start by saying that this was not actually a ladies’ coding camp, nor was it billed as such. I call it this due to the fact that my class was about 90% female, and I formed incredible, lasting friendships with nearly everyone there. We even had a Valentines Day reunion roughly 6 hours after leaving one another because we JUST COULDN’T HANDLE THE SEPARATION. This is less a review of the bougie villa learning experience itself, and more a rambling exploration of how meaningful these 10 days were, and the lasting effects I still feel a year later.</p>

      I heard about The Institute of Code (IOC) from a travel blogger and former SF resident whom I met in a hostel in the capital of Slovenia—as one does. She in turn had discovered it through The Blonde Abroad, a site I knew nothing about at the time but have since grown to appreciate for its insights on traveling alone while female (but I also totally hate it because it gives me anxiety that I’m not traveling well enough and I don’t have an assistant in charge of my 6 suitcases). Because I live my life on the recommendations of strangers, after a cursory glance and a Skype interview I was totally sold, and locked in my spot for 10 days in Bali, at the end of which I was promised I would have a fully functional site that didn’t involve incoherent HTML inline-formatting like ones I have built in the past.

      But what I failed to appreciate until I was actually on the ground in Canggu was the course’s overwhelming female presence. The company was founded by a couple, but of the two, it’s the woman who knows how to code. And she’s fucking good at it. She’s possibly even better at teaching it, which is what enables a course to actually, truly teach you how to build a site in a week and a half. You won’t learn Javascript; you won’t be able to get a job in the industry; BUT you will have a fully formed site and the necessary groundwork to keep learning on your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A series of women led me to the course, and the men and women I met there shaped the rest of my trip and my life after. I’ve generally had positive experiences with the male backpackers I meet, because there is a sense of equality and respect within the community. Everyone is carrying their home on their back, making sacrifices when it comes to comfort and not-having-food-poisoning, and putting themselves in unfamiliar circumstances. The men I met at coding camp were no exception; they thought nothing of learning from women and never tried to act like they knew better because “men are more tech-y.” This was such a pleasant change from my prior experience with trying to learn to code in America. Well, a pleasant change from trying to learn really anything with men in America. I love my American boys, but they aren’t always great at listening to the women in the room.

      The fact that IOC DOESN’T brand itself as “for women” or “by women” (like FUBU but with coding and vaginas!) is, I think, one of its greatest strengths. I don’t think there is anything wrong with having explicitly female-only courses, but it was somehow more powerful to see so many women sign up for a class in a male-dominated industry that weren’t there because OMG IT’S JUST FOR US LADIES! These were a bunch of nasty women (yes, I’m still using that) who wanted to learn to code for a variety of reasons, saw this as a cool opportunity to do so and were like “I’m in!” It undermines any idea that women are somehow not actually drawn to these often high-paying industries (self-selecting out), but that maybe, just maybe, the traditional learning environment for said industries isn’t exactly welcoming. Actually, I’ve had plenty of men be very critical of their coding education as well; it’s like a lot of Western education—too much theory and too slow to adapt.
