  <h1>Who is Trish Montaine?</h1>
  <p>
    Trish Montaine is the manifestation of Trash Mountain, a delapidated college house that was  the bane of the well-manicured surrounding neighborhood.  An eyesore filled with an average of six students, it was the birthplace of such genius ideas as outside couch, free-range hamsters, and roofs as fully acceptable bedrooms.  It was in this environment that the alter-ego known as Trish was born.
    Unrestrained by convention or future employers' use of Google, Trish is able to speak her mind without fear of her opinions and "inappropriate" language causing her real world harm.  In the era of men's rights vilianties, it also makes her slightly harder to doxx, because threats of (often sexual) violence happen enough offline.
    Trish also does not allow comments on her site, but welcomes them on her Facebook posts.  Facebook is the environment for online arguing; trishmontaine.com is not.  Trish doesn't give a shit about likes, so feel free to share away, and if you hate her you can rant and rant on Facebook until you're blocked or give yourself an aneurism.
    Long live Trash Mountain.
