      Trish Montaine is the manifestation of Trash Mountain, a delapidated college house deeply hated by the well-manicured surrounding neighborhood. An eyesore, it was repeatedly fined by the city just for existing, but was the birthplace of such genius ideas as outside couch, free-range hamsters, and roofs as fully acceptable bedrooms. It was in this environment that the identity known as Trish was born.

      Unrestrained by convention or future employers' use of Google, Trish is able to speak her mind without fear of her opinions and "inappropriate" language causing her real world harm. TM is a brand, a pen-name, an alter-ego, and a form of freedom. A "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am..._Sasha_Fierce">Sasha Fierce</a>," if you will.

      This site is by no means an authority on feminism, or politics, or anything, really. All opinions should be taken with a grain of salt, and all important facts will be cited. Don't take TM too seriously, but read with an open mind, and feel free to comment away on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/trishmontaine">Facebook</a>. Happy reading.
