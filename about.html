      Trish Montaine is the manifestation of Trash Mountain, a semi-condemned college house and neighborhood eyesore. It was repeatedly fined by the city just for existing, but was the birthplace of such genius ideas as outside couch, free-range hamsters, and roofs as fully acceptable bedrooms. It was in this environment that the identity known as Trish was born.

      Unrestrained by convention or future employers' use of Google, Trish is able to speak her mind without fear of her opinions and "inappropriate" language causing her real world harm. TM is a brand, a pen-name, an alter-ego, and a form of freedom--a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am..._Sasha_Fierce">Sasha Fierce</a>," if you will.

      Trish is also an attempt to get back to something optimistic and self-assured that is often lost as one moves into adulthood. By no means naive about how shitty things can be, TM tries to find a balance between idealism and reality, while seeing the world and its many issues in unique ways.  Hopefully it's at least somewhat successful. Happy reading.
